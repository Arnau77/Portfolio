                I'm a game developer and programmer who has finished studying a degree of Design and Development of Video Games in the CITM (UPC) in Terrassa and now is looking for a job to enter the industry. Thanks to this degree I learned a lot about programming
                (mostly C, C++ & C#) and also a lot about designing videogames. Apart from learning, I also have been able to do some projects both during my time studying in the university and in summer during my free time. Nowadays, while searching for a job, I'm
                doing a videogame with some of my college colleagues to get experience and improve both my programming and teamwork skills.
